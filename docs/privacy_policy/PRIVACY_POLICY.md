**Last Updated:** December 10, 2025  
**Author:** GeminiCLI Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental

## Introduction

Custom Script Injector ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally

Custom Script Injector stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **Custom Scripts**: CSS and JavaScript code you create for specific domains
- **Domain Aliases**: Custom names you assign to domains
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: If you choose to use the GitHub Gist sync feature (stored in local storage, never synced)
- **Language Preference**: Your selected interface language

### Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we **do not** do:

- ❌ We do **NOT** collect any personal information
- ❌ We do **NOT** track your browsing history
- ❌ We do **NOT** send any data to external servers (except GitHub Gist if you explicitly enable sync)
- ❌ We do **NOT** use analytics or tracking tools
- ❌ We do **NOT** share your data with third parties

## How We Use Your Information

All data is stored locally on your device and is used solely to:

1. **Execute Custom Scripts**: Apply your CSS and JavaScript to the websites you specify
2. **Sync Across Devices** (Optional): If you enable GitHub Gist sync, your scripts are uploaded to your private GitHub Gist account

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub Gist (Optional)

If you choose to use the backup/restore feature:

- You must provide a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Your scripts are uploaded to a **private Gist** in your GitHub account
- We do not have access to your GitHub account or token
- Please review [GitHub's Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API
- GitHub tokens are stored in local storage and are never synced via Chrome Sync
- We use secure APIs (`declarativeNetRequest`, `scripting`) to inject scripts

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **Access**: View all your scripts in the Options page
- **Modify**: Edit or delete any script at any time
- **Export**: Backup your scripts to GitHub Gist
- **Delete**: Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data

## Children's Privacy

This extension is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
